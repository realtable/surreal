`surreal` is a Rust library that implements J. H. Conway's surreal numbers, as
explained in the book *[Surreal Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201038129)*
by Donald Knuth. This crate provides an interface to the rules and theorems in
the book and (so far) contains:

* a basic surreal type
  * comparison and ordering
  * arithmetic system
* ~~numbers past aleph day~~
  * ~~infinite sets~~
  * ~~constants (ω and ε)~~
* ~~decimal/surreal conversion~~
* ~~pseudo-number implementation~~
